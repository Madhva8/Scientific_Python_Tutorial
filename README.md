# Scientific Python Tutorial
Grasping Scientific computing is never been easy before. Uploading jupyter notebooks are easier, but I found it easier to have complete source code instead of blocks of code. My style of uploading source code are always numeric. Lowest are the basic and highest are the advance. But these source codes are only to grasp fundamentals of scientific python programming. 

Here are some of the libraries we are going to use in this repository
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Scipy
